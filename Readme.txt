1. we use the same method to run the input:
OptimizeMakespan.java small_000_10x10_20_10.instance.json 

MotionViewer small_000_10x10_20_10.instance.json small_000_10x10_20_10_makespan.json

2. the main function is:

Multiagent_Planning.java

Agent.java

Map.java

AugementSolution.java

AugmentSolution.java

the others are auxiliary classes or experimental methods

3. we define N = 1, S = 2, W = 3, E = 4

4. Some results are in the solution, we didn't test all the instance, most of them are so large that they will take a lot of time.
